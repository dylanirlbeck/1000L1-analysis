HOW FAST TREE WORKS
FastTree has five main stages
  1. Heuristic Neighbor-Joining
    - Uses a heuristic variant of neighbor joining (stores profiles of internal nodes),
      does not compute distance matrix'

  2. Minimum Evolution
    - Tries to reduce the length of the tree using NNI's and SPR's
    - FastTree needs to estimate distances between sequences or profiles
    - For nucleotide sequences, uses the Jukes-Cantor distance
    - When comparing two sequences, gaps are ignored; when comparing profiles, positions
      weighted by proportions of non-gaps

  3. Maximizing the tree's likelihood
    - FastTree uses the generalized time-reversible models to improve tree w/ ML rearrangements
    - "By default, FastTree accounts for variable rates of evolution across sites by assigning each
      site to one of 20 categories, with the rates geometrically spaced from 0.05 to 20. FastTree sets
      each site to its most likely category by using a Bayesian approach with a gamma prior. This prevents
      overfitting on small alignments."
    - FasTree search for more likely topology faster than RAxML b/c
      1. Maintains a single topology at any given moment
      2. Optimizes site rate categories and other parameters only once
      3. Does not traverse into subtrees that have not seen significant improvement in likelihood
      4. Limits number of rounds of NNI's to ensure predictable running time

   4. Local support values
